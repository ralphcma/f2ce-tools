-- ── Post-mount view sync ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Mudlet's 2D mapper draws a room cell at min(widgetW, widgetH) / areaZoom
-- pixels, and it takes both its zoom AND its displayed area from whatever
-- f2t_map_handle_gmcp_room() last applied via setMapZoom()/centerview().  Until
-- that has run *with a live native mapper*, the widget keeps some other area at
-- some other zoom — which renders as a couple of rooms blown up to the size of
-- the whole pane.
--
-- A single attempt at mount is not enough.  Two independent ways it misses:
--   * gmcp.room.info has not landed yet (the handler early-returns), which is
--     common on the new-character path where the room burst trails the UI build;
--   * the native mapper is not up yet, and setMapZoom() fails soft with
--     "no active mapper" — it returns nil + message rather than raising.
-- Either miss used to persist until the player moved.  It only looked rare
-- because a *first-run* profile also runs the silent map import, whose
-- tempTimer(0.5, f2t_map_sync) happened to re-apply the view as a side effect;
-- profiles that skip the import (and unlucky first-run ones) had nothing.
--
-- There is a third miss, and measurement showed it is the one that actually
-- bites: the widget's GEOMETRY, not its zoom (see settleView below).  A fix
-- that only re-applied zoom/centre was built and A/B tested against the
-- released package and did NOT repair the view — zoom was already correct.
-- Hence the settle loop refits the widget every tick rather than gating on
-- viewIsApplied(), which is kept only as a debug-log signal.
