-- Galaxy topology model.
--
-- Jump legality is a pure function of: which cartel each system belongs to,
-- which syndicate each cartel belongs to, each hub system (cartel hub ==
-- cartel name, syndicate hub cartel == syndicate name, except Prime whose hub
-- is Sol), and each syndicate's beacon builds. This module owns those facts
-- and derives every link room's "jump <system>" special exits from them, so
-- Mudlet's native getPath() plans over exactly the legal jump graph.
-- Sources of truth: gmcp.room.info.jumps corrects the model as you travel
-- (f2t_map_topology_apply_gmcp); "display cartels"/"display syndicates"
-- captures sync it wholesale (topology_capture.lua).
--
-- Rule set (verified against game server code):
--   1. Always: any member system -> every accepted member of its own cartel.
--   2. From a cartel hub: -> every other cartel hub in the same syndicate.
--   3. Hub Beacon (never Prime): from anywhere in the syndicate -> every
--      accepted member system of every sibling cartel.
--   4. From the syndicate hub system: -> every other syndicate's hub system.
--   5. Distant Beacon (never Prime): from anywhere in the syndicate -> every
--      other syndicate's hub system.
-- Jump edges are directed; destination-side builds never affect legality, so
-- never create a reverse exit by symmetry.

-- systems[name]    = cartel name (accepted members only)
-- cartels[name]    = syndicate name, or false when the cartel is known but
--                    its syndicate is not yet
-- syndicates[name] = {hub_beacon=bool, distant_beacon=bool}
-- closed[name]     = os.time() of a refusal that proved the system shut to
--                    *this* player. Membership and openness are separate
--                    facts: membership makes an edge legal, openness makes it
--                    usable. Absence means open, never unknown-so-closed -
--                    the server's own lists are per-player, so a system it
--                    stops offering may simply be out of rules range.
-- exiled[name]     = os.time() you were turned back at that system's border.
--                    Kept apart from closed: the server deliberately still
--                    offers jumps to systems you are exiled from, so GMCP
--                    presence retires a closure but never an exile.
-- refused[from][to] = os.time() the server denied a specific edge outright
--                    ("no direct link"). Directed, and dropped on the next
--                    successful sync, which re-derives from authority.
