# `F2CE.API.v1` reference

All data returned across the API boundary is copied. Errors are tables with `code`, `message`, optional copied `details`, and a useful `tostring(error)` value. Functions return `nil, error` when they fail closed.

## Metadata and dependency validation

- `API.version`: semantic API version (`1.2.0`; candidate build).
- `API.f2ce_version`: installed F2CE package version.
- `API.info()`: copied API/F2CE/adapter/capability/integration record.
- `API.hasCapability(name)`, `API.getCapabilities()`, `API.requireCapabilities(names)`.
- `API.validateDependency({api=">=1.0.0", f2ce=">=3.3.0", capabilities={...}})`.
- `API.versions.compare(a,b)` and `API.versions.satisfies(actual, requirement)`; operators are `=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, and `~` (same major/minor, at least the requested patch).

Capabilities include `modules`, `events`, `navigation`, `navigation.status.v33`, `commands`, `commands.native_contention`, `gmcp.snapshots`, `prices.providers`, `hauling`, `hauling.exchange_override`, `map.queries`, and `muxlet.content` when `Mux.registerContent` is available. The two dotted 3.3 capabilities let modules distinguish the explicit navigation-status and native-contention contracts from the legacy fallback.

`API.integration` identifies this API's scope as F2CE gameplay services and identifies Muxlet as the UI/content provider. Visual integrations should call `Mux.registerContent` directly; this API does not wrap Muxlet.

## Modules and scoped context

### Native consumer services added in 1.2

- `data.receipt(channel)` returns a copied generation, global sequence, receipt
  time, data, frozen room and mapped `room_id`. Only genuine GMCP events advance
  this journal. `data.refresh(channel)` updates cache without creating freshness.
  Normalized data events include `received` and an optional `receipt`.
- `data.mapRoomId(room)` resolves the server's `system.area.num` hash. Server
  local numbers are not mapper IDs; unresolved hashes return nil.
- `navigation.environment()` is copied native state. `navigation.verify(ctx,
  destination, options)` provides bounded semantic re-resolution/retries and
  authoritative arrival checks. Options include `on_arrival`, `on_failure`,
  `on_retry`, `require_exchange`, timeout (15–600 seconds), max_attempts (1–4),
  max_room_visits (2–5). The returned session has `status()`/`cancel(reason)`;
  deliberate cancellation does not call the failure callback. No map edits or
  guessed exits are performed, and foreign navigation is never stopped.
- `actions.command(ctx, operation, payload)` validates authorization and builds
  futures.refresh/buy/liquidate or prices.premium/local commands. `actions.send`
  also acquires/releases the broker. These require the module's explicit
  `authorize(operation,payload)` callback. A send receipt is not game acceptance.
- `discovery.system(ctx,name,callback)` returns a cancellable leased operation.
  Callback receives planets, excluded, missing, failure. `trading.bulk(ctx,
  {side,commodity,lots},callback)` accepts buy/sell and 1–100 lots; callback carries
  the native confirmed count/status. Neither assumes transport means success.
- `settings.get(component,key)` and `character.hasRank(rank)` are read-only.
- `prices.analyze(commodity,lines,count)` returns parsed/analysis copies with a
  validated 1–20 result count; `prices.display` invokes native presentation.
  The stock checker has an explicit native provider hook for API-owned hauling;
  only that owner's provider may borrow its hauling broker lease. It does not
  replace the global checker. Foreign activity and captures remain blockers.
- `protection.attach(ctx,{pause,resume,isActive,onHandoffFailure})` registers an
  owner-scoped stamina client with `isOwned`, `status`, `ensure`, and `detach`.
  Call `ensure()` after saving the returned handle: it can synchronously invoke
  pause at low stamina. Pause must release unsent navigation. Already-sent steps
  require fresh matching room receipts within 10 seconds before food travel.
  Incomplete command operations, unknown movement, foreign owners, death and
  timeout fail closed. `deathState`, `isRecovering`, `staminaState` and `status`
  expose copied protection data; events include death.started/completed and
  stamina.handoff_ready/failed. No literal `yes` or alternate navigator is used.

Capabilities added: `gmcp.receipts`, `commands.typed`, `po.discovery`,
`trading.bulk`, `prices.analysis`, `prices.hauling_provider`, `settings.read`,
`protection.stamina`, `protection.death`. Read `api.ready` through the API or
Mudlet's `f2ceApiReady` notification when the package finishes installing its
adapter. Readiness grants no gameplay authority.

### Registry

- `API.modules.register(spec)` where `spec.id` is a lowercase dotted ID and `spec` may define `version`, `requires`, `initialize(context)`, `enable(context)`, `disable(context,reason)`, and `unload(context,reason)`.
- `initialize(id)`, `enable(id)`, `disable(id,reason)`, `unload(id,reason)`, `unregister(id,reason)`, `reload(spec)`, and `status(id)`.
- `context:on(api_event,callback)` subscribes to F2CE API service events.
- `context:own(kind,resource,cleanup)` attaches an explicit cleanup token for a resource created through Mudlet, Muxlet, or another library.

Callbacks registered through a context are gated on the current enabled generation. Cleanup is reverse-order and idempotent.

The context does not create aliases, triggers, timers, HTTP requests, widgets, or general Mudlet event handlers. Those remain with their native owner. For example, a package can create an alias with `tempAlias` and attach its ID using `context:own("mudlet_alias", id, killAlias)`.

## Navigation

`lease, err = API.navigation.acquire(context, metadata)` acquires the sole API lease only if no native navigation owner or known native automation is active. `lease:request(destination, options)` returns a handle. Options: `suppress_hint`, `interactive`, `compensate_incomplete_map`, `on_complete(result)`, `on_failure(result)`, and `on_interrupt(result)`. The first three map directly to F2CE-Tools 3.3.0 navigation options. Returning `{auto_resume=true}` from the interruption callback requests F2CE's supported customs recovery behavior.

Request state is normalized from the 3.3.0 native start status: `walking` becomes `running`, `pending` remains `pending`, `arrived` completes immediately, and `failed` is rejected. A pending self-healing route is not completed by an intermediate speedwalk's `LAST_RESULT`; it remains pending until native resolution advances it or the requested destination resolves to the current room. Releasing a lease clears the native owner only when the API's owner token still matches.

Handle functions: `status()`, `pause()`, `resume()`, `cancel(reason)` (graceful, finalized on the next service tick), and `cancelImmediate(reason)`. `lease:release(reason)` is allowed only when no request is active. `API.navigation.status()` returns `{state="idle"}` or a copied request record.

Events: `navigation.lease_acquired`, `.lease_released`, `.started`, `.paused`, `.resumed`, `.cancelling`, `.interrupted`, `.completed`, and `.failed`. Request fields include `request_id`, `lease_id`, `module_id`, `destination`, `state`, timestamps, `reason`, `interruption_reason`, `detail`, and copied progress.

## Commands

`lease = API.commands.acquire(context, metadata)` obtains the sole command lease. `lease:send(command,{reason="...", echo=false, ...})` transmits only while the owning module remains enabled. `lease:release(reason)` revokes it. Navigation and arbitrary command leases are mutually exclusive. Acquisition fails while known native speedwalk, exploration, circuit, hauling, death-recovery, bulk-trade, or command/response capture state is active; every API send rechecks that state and fails closed with zero transmission if it changed. `API.commands.audit()` returns copied bounded history.

`command.sent` / `command.failed` fields: `id`, `module_id`, `lease_id`, `command`, copied `metadata`, `timestamp`, `status`, and optional `reason`. These report transport only, not game acceptance. `command.acknowledged` remains a deprecated transport alias for backward compatibility.

## Exchange capture and stock settings (1.1)

Capabilities: `exchange.capture`, `exchange.settings`.
`session = API.exchange.acquire(context,{reason="explicit reviewed operation"})`
holds the existing command lease across related operations. A disabled module,
foreign API lease, or known native automation prevents acquisition.

- `session:capture(kind,planet,callback,{timeout=15})`: kind is `exchange` or
  `production`; planet may be nil for local capture. Callback `(rows,error)`
  receives copied native PO results. Remote response headers must identify the
  requested planet. Exchange results include `_expected_count` from the summary.
  The consumer must validate completeness before acting on the data.
- `session:set({kind,commodity,value,planet})`: typed setting command. Accepted
  ranges are integer min 0–10000, max 0–20000, spread 6–40. Local operations
  require current owner/player GMCP equality; remote ownership is enforced by
  the server. A sent result is not a server acknowledgement.
- `session:status()`, `session:release(reason)`: release cancels only the capture
  callback owned by that session. The client must release after a capture pair
  or confirmed apply sequence. Disable/unload/reconnect also clean the session.

`exchange.captured` / `exchange.capture_failed` carry copied `kind`, `planet`,
`module_id`, `rows`, and optional `error`. Invalid kinds, names, numbers,
contention, missing capabilities, disabled contexts and timeouts fail closed.

The native [Exchange Walker integration](NATIVE_EXCHANGE_WALKER.md) demonstrates
complete capture validation and one-at-a-time acknowledged setting changes.
Reconnect now disables every enabled module; consumers must explicitly enable
again, rather than obtaining new leases with old connection authority.

## Copied GMCP data

`API.data.get(channel)`, `refresh(channel)`, and `channels()`. Channels and events:

| Channel | Normalized event | Established source |
|---|---|---|
| `room` | `data.room` | `gmcp.room.info` |
| `vitals` | `data.vitals` | `gmcp.char.vitals` |
| `ship` | `data.ship` | `gmcp.char.ship` |
| `cargo` | `data.cargo` | `gmcp.char.ship.cargo` |
| `jobs_board` | `data.jobs_board` | `gmcp.jobs.board` |
| `job` | `data.job` | `gmcp.char.job` |
| `commodities` | `data.commodities` | `gmcp.exchange.commodities` |
| `futures_market` | `data.futures_market` | `gmcp.exchange.futures` |
| `futures_owned` | `data.futures_owned` | `gmcp.char.futures` |
| `business` | `data.business` | `gmcp.char.business` (Industrialist) |
| `company` | `data.company` | `gmcp.char.company` (Manufacturer/Financier) |

Each event is `{channel, available, value, timestamp}`. `value` is a deep copy and may be `nil` for absent/partial GMCP.

## Owner-bound company and depot reads

`API.company.snapshot()` returns the copied business/company and its receipt,
selected by current rank and checked against the current character's CEO name.
No cross-rank cache fallback is used. `refresh(context, callback)` sends
`di business` or `di company` and waits for a real rank-specific GMCP event.
`inspect(context, factoryNumber, callback)` reads a complete owned factory display.

Native ew21 adds capability `company.depot.read` and
`API.company.depot(context, planet, callback)`. The planet must appear in this
owner's snapshot. One broker lease sends `display depot <planet>` followed by
the rank-appropriate company/business read. Its exact owner-bound header closes
the depot display; fresh GMCP is also mandatory. Manufacturer capacity, occupancy
and efficiency must agree with the following report. Industrialist reports have
no occupancy count, so their completeness boundary is the ordered read fence.
Quiet intervals and partial rows are never accepted as complete inventory.

Result fields: `owner`, `ceo`, `planet`, `capacity`, `used_bays`, `free_bays`,
`workforce`, `efficiency`, `bays`, `inventory`, `captured_at`, `completeness`.
Each bay has `number`, `commodity`, `tons=75`, `cost_per_ton`, `origin`, `system`;
inventory maps lower-case commodities to total tons. All three asynchronous
methods return cancel/status handles, require explicit module authorization,
hold ownership through response processing, time out in 15 seconds, and clean
up on disable/reconnect. Callback `(value,error)` runs after lease release.
The new operation is `company.depot.inspect`; no store/fetch or spend API is
exposed. Remote inspection proves neither ship access nor future inventory.

## Price provider operations

`API.prices.registerProvider(context,{id,priority,scopes,capabilities,request})` returns a scoped registration token. `request(provider_request,done)` returns `false` to decline or calls `done(result)` / `done(nil,error)`. `provider_request:send(command,metadata)` uses the serialized service command lease and audit trail. It also exposes copied `options`, `commodity`, `id`, and `isCancelled()`.

`API.prices.request(context,commodity,{scope,timeout,...},callback)` returns a cancel/status handle. Providers run by descending priority, then the built-in `f2t_price_check_commodity` provider. Events: `provider.registered`, `.queued`, `.started`, `.timed_out`, `.completed`, `.failed`.

## Hauling

`API.hauling.start(context,{mode="auto"|"exchange"})` delegates to F2CE's rank-aware state machine. `auto` passes no override; `exchange` is the supported Founder+ exchange override. No hauling algorithm is duplicated. The API verifies that native state actually became active; cargo, rank, or other synchronous native rejection releases the service command lease and returns `E_HAUL_START`. The returned handle exposes `status`, `pause`, `resume`, `cancel` (graceful), and `cancelImmediate`. Top-level equivalents and `API.hauling.status()` are also available.

Events: `hauling.started`, `hauling.state`, and `hauling.stopped`. Status copies the established F2CE state fields, including `active`, `paused`, `mode`, `current_phase`, `stopping`, and counters when present.

## Map queries

- `API.map.roomHasFlag(room_id,flag)`.
- `findRoomsWithFlag(area_id_or_name,flag)`.
- `findExchange(area_id_or_name)` returns copied `{room_id,name,area_id}` records.
- `resolve(location)` returns `{room_id,error,hint}`.
- `areas()` and `systems()` return copied sorted records.
- `reachability(from_room,to_room)` returns `{reachable,from_room,to_room,directions,rooms}` copies.

## Reconnect and schema discovery

`reconnect.reset` is emitted after leases/active work are revoked and caches cleared. `API.schemas` documents required fields for `module.state`, `navigation.*`, `hauling.*`, `provider.*`, `command.acknowledged`, `data.*`, and `reconnect.reset`.
